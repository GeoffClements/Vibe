# Some ideas for future developments

1. [x] Remove dependency on pulseaudio if only rodio is needed

2. [ ] Implement SSL.

3. [x] Extract metadata from the stream (Icy not needed, uses Symphonia).

4. [x] dbus integration. Show metadata and possibly control the player (although the LMS should be doing this).

5. [ ] Keep trying to get player sync in good working order.
