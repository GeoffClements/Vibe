# Some ideas for future developments

1. Remove dependency on pulseaudio if only rodio is needed.

2. Implement SSL.

3. Extract Icy metadata from the stream.

4. dbus integration. Show metadata and possibly control the player (although the LMS should be doing this).

5. Keep trying to get player sync in good working order.
